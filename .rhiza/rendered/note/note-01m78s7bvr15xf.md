## statement

This change set builds on accepted 01M78FD0 (depends-on). Its leaves are new capabilities because 01M78FD0's nodes are not landed: ci-unstable-repeated-flake narrows ci-stability-state and 01M78FD0's local-gate-trigger-identified-flakes (2 flakes of one named test, not one identified flake); ship-gate-run-log replaces 01M78FD0's ship-gate-full-log log location (one file per gate run in the run dir, not rhiza/gate/<branch>.log replaced each run, except outside a run). Decision local-gate-repeated-named-flakes rules. Not breaking: ShipGateResponse and the CI stability record only gain fields.

### Out

- discusses change set `01M78RM7PFF8KV94344XM3V8DH` (The local ship gate switches on only for an identified flake that repeats, and keeps its full log. Owner, 2026-11-12, after the performance report ('Well that's disappointing'), agreed to file the orchestrator's recommendation. Today one CI flake with no named test ('scripts (4/4) / UNKNOWN STEP' on #498 at ~16:24, auto-filed 01M78960; 29 of the last 30 CI runs were green) marked CI unstable and switched rhiza.ship.localGate (make check, serialized by the machine-wide test lock, ~20 min each) on for every run: about 525 run-minutes lost across 4 runs, run 01M787SV alone ~208 min over 4 local-gate visits (16:32-19:41). Wanted: (1) CI counts as unstable only for a flake that names a failing test and has failed more than once in the window (a step-level or UNKNOWN STEP failure is infra, not a flake); (2) the gate stores its full output as a file in the run dir and the journal points to it, instead of keeping only the last ~2 KB (today the failing test's name was cut off, so every gate-fix agent reran the whole suite); (3) the gate's reason names the flake and when it stops applying. Evidence: perf report ~/orchestrator/perf-2026-11-12/report-prospective.md; related bug 01M78CSH (rootguard false positive that made every gate fail).)
