## statement

When the binary's entry FormatVersion is higher than the one a persistent index was built with, how should the index recover entries it stored with a newer-format problem? / Should this change set also prune index databases of worktrees that no longer exist (~/.cache/rhiza/index holds 1580 dbs, 14G)?

## History

- `01M73T319T5VT2Q37MFXTDP8T6` Fix The persistent index keeps an entry's newer-format problem after the binary learns that format, so change sets stay unlanded forever. After #424 bumped the entry format to 5 and the daemon self-updated, the three milestone-31 docs change sets (01M71G4BKFHP1E172RR6H82WFT, 01M71G4G92NEJ33C04DSKC4RMK, 01M71G4MMC4VGT41WVM4A33ZWM) merged (PRs 426-428, runs 01M73CQ3T, 01M73CQ4D, 01M73CQ4C succeeded) but folded as accepted and stayed in rhiza ready/roadmap as ready. rhiza change show 01M71G4G92 --json problems: 'entry out of order: after names 01M731FQPE9PY5EYQTA9H0C4CF, which is not an entry of this change set' (the v5 pin entry, written while the installed binary read v4), then every later entry, the land included, 'left out of the fold'. With a fresh cache (XDG_CACHE_HOME=empty dir) the same binary folds it landed with no problems. Cause: internal/index stores each listed entry file with its problem and only re-reads a file when its listing changes; a rebuild happens only on a vanished path or a schema change (internal/index/index.go doc, ~l.40), so an entry stored as newer-format is never re-decoded after an upgrade to a binary whose entry.FormatVersion covers it. Expected: the index records the FormatVersion it decoded with and re-decodes (or rebuilds) entries stored with a newer-format problem when the binary's FormatVersion rises; a test writes a v(N+1) entry, opens the index with FormatVersion N, then N+1, and the change set folds clean. Unstuck by moving ~/.cache/rhiza/index/<sha256 of /home/rhiza/code/rhiza>.db aside so it rebuilt. Side note: ~/.cache/rhiza/index holds 1580 dbs, 14G, mostly from test and run worktrees that no longer exist; nothing prunes them.
